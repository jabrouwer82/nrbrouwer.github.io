The name is Nick, the title is PhD student, and the affiliation is the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Merced. I come by way of the University of Texas at Dallas with a BA in International Political Economy Dallas and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin with an MA in Global Policy Studies.
My interests largely lay with indigenous political institutions and spatial data, and the intersection of the two.
